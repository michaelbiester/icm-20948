# ICM20948 / 9-axis MEMS motion-tracking device

The ICM20948 looked quite promising from what can be inferred from the datasheet.

To explore some of the features of this chip and how to program it via Python on a Raspberry Pi I collected some facts which are summarised in this PDF document:

[icm_20948_getting_started.pdf](./icm_20948_getting_started.pdf) 

Some basic tests with the

1) accelerometer

2) gyroscope

have been performed and displayed in a Jupyter notebook

The result of this notebook can also be viewed as a PDF-document.
